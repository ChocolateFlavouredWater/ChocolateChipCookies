Any sort of cookie can warm up the room, brighten the mood, and cheer up any sort of day, whether rain, shine, snow, or storm.  The chocolate chip cookie, mother of all cookies, the OG, the definite **one** can be an on the go snack, or one to eat while curled up on the couch with a book. 


### Ingredients 

*This recipe makes around 3 dozen cookies. (Divide amounts if needed :D)*

- 2 1/4 cup of all-purpose flour
- 1/2 cup of granulated (white, not powdered) sugar
- 1 cup of (light) brown sugar
- 1 teaspoon of salt
- 1/2 teaspoon of baking *soda*
- 1 cup (2 sticks, USA) of *un*salted butter, room temperature (microwave for a short amount of time if waiting is not possible, otherwise, set it out around 2 hours before starting)
- 2 (large) eggs
- 2 teaspoon of pure vanilla extract
- 12 ounces of (semisweet) chocolate chips or 12 ounces of chopped (of your favorite type of) chocolate

### Baker's Note
1. The sugar will decide the color, not taste (only slight differences) of your cookies, so if one type is not avalible, use 1 1/2 cup of the other, or mix and match the ratios. (make sure it adds up to 1 1/2 cup)
2. If you completely melt your butter, your cookie will come out flat, crumbly, rough and less to not chewy
3. The more flour you will add to your cookie without changing the amounts of your other ingredients, the cookie will rise, and become fluffy in general
